# Usage
## General
Recommended way of importing the package is by:
```python
from analysis import *
``` 

## Example notebooks
All example notebooks are part of the git repository in the [example_nbs/ subfolder](https://github.com/palec87/cbr-analysis/tree/master/example_nbs).

The most basic explanation of loading and manipulating spectroscopy datasets is explained on the TA class. Other example files demonstrate functionalities of other Spectroscopy experiments.

1. TA: example_TA.ipynb
2. PLQE: example_PLQE.ipynb

The rest of the modules are heavily under development so please refer to Developer Iterface for docs of every method available to you.

Alternatively, check the developmental branches for each experiment on the [GitHub](https://github.com/palec87/cbr-analysis/branches).
